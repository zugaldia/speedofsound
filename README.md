## GNOME Shell Extension

Speed of Sound includes an optional GNOME Shell extension for enhanced functionality. The extension provides:

- Status indicator in the top bar
- System-wide keyboard shortcut
- Desktop notifications

**Installation**: [Follow the extension setup instructions](./extension/README.md) 

## Activation

Choose how to activate voice input:

1. **GNOME Shell Extension** (Recommended) - Use `Super+Z` to start/stop voice typing from any application
2. **Custom Keyboard Shortcut** - Set up a global shortcut without the extension
3. **Joystick/Gamepad** - Use a connected controller for activation

For manual shortcuts and joystick setup, see the [trigger configuration guide](docs/trigger.md).

## Configuration

Speed of Sound uses a `config.toml` file for all settings. Start by copying the example configuration:

```bash
cp config.example.toml config.toml
```

The default configuration uses a local Whisper server for privacy-focused speech recognition. For additional providers and configuration options, see the [configuration documentation](docs/config.md).
