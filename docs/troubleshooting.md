# Troubleshooting

## Testing Your Setup

Speed of Sound includes a dashboard window to test your voice typing setup. When you launch the application, use the test interface to verify that:

1. Your microphone is working correctly
2. Speech recognition is transcribing your voice accurately
3. The virtual keyboard is typing into applications as expected

If the test fails, check your configuration in the Preferences menu or refer to the setup documentation.
