# Logo

## Prompt

Original icon generated with ChatGPT 4o with the following prompt:

> Create an image icon for an app store listing. The image should be a clean, vector-style logo with no text or background. The design should follow the visual style of GNOME desktop icons: simple shapes, soft gradients or subtle shading, and a flat, modern aesthetic. The central motif should be a microphone with wings, rendered in retro tones. The microphone should be clearly recognizable but stylized to match GNOME icon design language (e.g., soft edges, minimal detail, and balanced proportions).
