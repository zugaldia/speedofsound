# - disableGioStore: When true, uses Java Properties for settings instead of GSettings.
#   Helpful when running the shadow JAR standalone outside an installed environment
#   where GSettings is not available (e.g., not in Snap/Flatpak). Typically, the Properties
#   file will be placed under $HOME/.local/share/speedofsound/speedofsound.properties
speedofsound.disableGioStore=false

# - disableGStreamer: When true, falls back to Java's built-in sound libraries
#   (javax.sound.sampled) instead of GStreamer bindings. Useful on systems where
#   GStreamer is not available/installed.
speedofsound.disableGStreamer=false
